This is a file Provied to me by https://github.com/abhisheksharm-3 and i hosted his website to GCP's VM for the least Cost possible.
First of all i took his website and then run the npm run dev command to finalize the visuals in the website and then git clone this repository to the VM in GCP to hsot the static website

This is the url to the website and you need to send a message so that i can host website when needed
http://34.29.126.5/

i just hosted this website as a first project to what i have learned in my Course from Coursera Google CLoud Professional Developer Course.
